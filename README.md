# CLexicon
Author: Dan McFalls (dmcfalls@stanford.edu)

Simple implementation of the lexicon data type in C.

Uses a tree structure in which each parent node has 26 children nodes, each representing a letter of the English alphabet.

Equivalent to a set of strings, but optimized for significantly improved efficiency when searching a large set of words.
